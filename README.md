> __R Interface to the [Metabolights REST API](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/ws/api/spec.html)__

To install the latest development version directly from GitHub;

```r
remotes::install_github('wilsontom/metabolighteR)
```

**metabolighteR** provides access to the Metabolights RESTful API. To get started you first need to [register](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/newAccount) and then obtain an API Token from your **Account Settings** page.

This API Token is required for the vest majority of the API calls, therefore it is a good idea to add the API token to your .Renviron (**NOTE**: *this is NOT recommended if you are using a shared workstation or a workstation where you cannot guarantee the secrecy of your API Token*). 

If you are adding the API Token to your .Renviron, you should use the following format;

```r
MTBLS_API_KEY="<your-api-token-here>"
```

Then once you load the library; you can set the API Token as an option variable. 

```r
library(metabolighteR)

mtbls_key()
```

If you haven't added your API Token to the .Renviron; the the API Token can be set as an option by passing the API Token as an argumnet in the `set_api_token` function.

```r
library(metabolighteR)

mtbls_key("<your-api-token_here>")
```
